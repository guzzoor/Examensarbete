This is what the GUI-prototype should contain.

1. A very basic login window. This will be the start window of the program. 

If login succeded the program will move on to 2., if not it will alert some message.

2. Main window. Should display:
    - some info about the current user. 
    - The userlog
    - All the hosts that you can connect to. Could be a list of buttons where each button
      is a host. If you press the button you will connect
    - Logout
    - Quit button to terminate the program
